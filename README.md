EPFL MT BA2 Programming in C++ (2020) - Project Archipelago
The goal is to make generate an abstract model of a city with various types of centers of attraction and connections. The city parameters can be opened from and saved to a file. The model can be modified following a set of rules. Various metrics are computed to represent the global quality of life. Shortest paths from A to B can be shown.
Project is done but kinda messy.
